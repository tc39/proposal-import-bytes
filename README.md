Status: Stage 2.

Please leave any feedback in the [issues](https://github.com/styfle/proposal-import-bytes/issues), thanks!

## Synopsis

This proposal is buit on top of [import attributes](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-attributes) and [immutable arraybuffer](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-immutable-arraybuffer) to add the ability to import arbitrary bytes in a common way across JavaScript environments.

Developers will then be able to import the bytes as follows:

```js
import bytes from "./photo.png" with { type: "bytes" };
const bytes = await import("./photo.png", { with: { type: "bytes" } });
```

The bytes are returned as a `Uint8Array` backed by an [immutable arraybuffer](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-immutable-arraybuffer).

Note: a similar proposal was mentioned in https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/9444

## Motivation

In a similar manner to why JSON modules are useful, importing raw bytes is useful to extend this behavior to all files. This proposal provides an isomorphic way to read a file synchronously or asynchronously, regardless of the JavaScript environment. 

For example, a developer may want to read a `.png` file to process an image or `.woff` to process a font and pass the bytes into isomorphic tools like [satori](https://github.com/vercel/satori).

Today, the developer must detect the platform in order to read the bytes.

```js
async function getBytes(path) {
  if (typeof Deno !== "undefined") {
    const bytes = await Deno.readFile(path);
    return bytes;
  }
  if (typeof Bun !== "undefined") {
    const bytes = await Bun.file(path).bytes();
    return bytes;
  }
  if (typeof require !== "undefined") {
    const fs = require("fs/promises");
    const bytes = await fs.readFile(path);
    return bytes;
  }
  if (typeof window !== "undefined") {
    const response = await fetch(path);
    const bytes = await response.bytes();
    return bytes;
  }
  throw new Error("Unsupported runtime");
}

const bytes = await getBytes("./photo.png");
```

We can maximize portability and reduce boilerplate by turning this into a single line of code:

```js
import bytes from "./photo.png" with { type: "bytes" };
```

Using an import also provides opportunity for further optimizations when using a bundler. For example, bundlers can statically analyze this import and inline as base64.

```js
const bytes = Uint8Array.fromBase64("iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkqAcAAIUAgUW0RjgAAAAASUVORK5CYII=")
```

## Proposed semantics and interoperability

If a module import has an attribute with key `type` and value `bytes`, the host is required to either fail the import, or treat it as a Uint8Array backed by an immutable ArrayBuffer. The Uint8Array object is the default export of the module (which has no named exports).

In browser environments, this will be equivalent to `fetch()` such that `sec-fetch-dest` will be empty. The response `content-type` will be ignored.

In "local" desktop/server/embedded, this will be equivalent to a file read. The file extension will be ignored.

All of the import statements in the module graph that address the same module will evaluate to the same Uint8Array object.

## FAQ

### How would this proposal work with caching?

The determination of whether the `type` attribute is part of the module cache key is left up to hosts (as it is for all import attributes).

For example, `import "foo"` and `import "foo" with { type: "bytes" }` may return the same module in one host, and different modules with another host. Both are valid implementations.

However, a dynamic import and a static import with the same `type` must return the same module, regardless of host.

See discussion in Issue https://github.com/styfle/proposal-import-bytes/issues/4

### Is there any prior art?

Deno 2.4 added support in [July 2025](https://deno.com/blog/v2.4) to inline a Uint8Array

```js
import imageBytes from "./image.png" with { type: "bytes" };
```

Bun 1.1.7 added a similar feature in [May 2024](https://bun.sh/blog/bun-v1.1.7) to inline a string of text

```js
import html from "./index.html" with { type: "text" };
```

webpack added [asset modules](https://webpack.js.org/guides/asset-modules/) to inline a base64 data URI via [url-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/url-loader) in 4.x and now `asset/inline` in 5.x

```js
import logo from "./images/logo.svg"
```

esbuild added a [binary loader](https://esbuild.github.io/content-types/#binary) to inline a Uint8Array

```js
import uint8array from "./example.data"
```

Parcel added a [data url](https://parceljs.org/features/bundle-inlining/#inlining-as-a-data-url) scheme to inline a base64 data URI

```js
import background from "data-url:./background.png";
```

Moddable added a [Resource](https://www.moddable.com/documentation/files/files#resource) class to inline a host buffer for embedded systems

```js
let resource = new Resource("logo.bmp");
```

### Why not mutable?

Mutable can be problematic for several reasons:

- may need multiple copies of the buffer in memory to avoid different underlying bytes for `import(specifier, { type: "json" })` and `import(specifier, { type: "bytes" })`
- may cause unexpected behavior when multiple modules import the same buffer and detach (say `postMessage()` or `transferToImmutable()`) in one module which would cause it to become detached in the other module too
- may cause excessive RAM usage for embedded system (immutable could use ROM instead)
- may cause excessive memory when tracking source maps
- may cause an undeniable global communication channel

See discussion in Issue https://github.com/styfle/proposal-import-bytes/issues/2 and https://github.com/styfle/proposal-import-bytes/issues/5 

### Why Uint8Array?

Uint8Array is compatible with [Node.js Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer) which makes it widely compatible with existing JavaScript code.

### Why not ArrayBuffer?

ArrayBuffers cannot be read from directly; the developer must create a view, such as a Uint8Array, to read data. Providing a Uint8Array avoids that additional effort.

This pattern is defined in the [W3C design principals](https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/#uint8array).

There was some discussion to switch to ArrayBuffer in Issue https://github.com/styfle/proposal-import-bytes/issues/5 however the plenary meeting reached concensus that Uint8Array is more desireable and the problems described in that issue can still be solved with Uint8Array, as long as it's backed by an Immutable ArrayBuffer.

### Why not Blob?

Blob is part of the W3C [File API](https://www.w3.org/TR/FileAPI/), not part of JavaScript, so it is not a viable solution to include in a TC39 Proposal. Furthermore, Blob typically includes a MIME Type but this proposal ignores the type. 

### Why not ReableStream?

ReadableStream is part of the WHATWG [Streams](https://streams.spec.whatwg.org), not part of JavaScript, so it is not a viable solution to include in a TC39 Proposal. Furthermore, there is [no helper method](https://github.com/whatwg/streams/issues/1019) to turn a stream into a buffer so this won't solve the original motivation of writing isomorphic JavaScript.

See discussion in Issue https://github.com/styfle/proposal-import-bytes/issues/3

### Why not a phase?

This proposal does not attempt to introduce a new phase like the [source](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-source-phase-imports) or [asset](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-asset-references) proposals.

A new phase would require a syntax change to JavaScript and cause `Sec-Fetch-Dest` to be script instead of empty. It also introduces security implications since importing arbitrary code could be malicious.

See discussion in Issue https://github.com/tc39/proposal-import-bytes/issues/16

### Why `type: bytes`?

The `type` attribute is proposed the same reason that it was introduced with `type: json`: to separate from code loading and provide a different `Sec-Fetch-Dest`.

The `type: bytes` name will be familiar to developers who are already using [Response.bytes()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Response/bytes) as well as [Blob.bytes()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Blob/bytes) which both return `Uint8Array`.
